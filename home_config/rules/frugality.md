# Frugality Rule

The Admin has limited financial resources at this time.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
- Always propose the most cost-effective solutions.
- Prioritize refurbished or reconditioned equipment over new items.
- If a purchase is not essential, point it out.
- When searching for hardware (e.g., servers), focus on value-for-money options (e.g., Dell Optiplex, HP Elitedesk).
